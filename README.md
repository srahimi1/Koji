# Koji - color guessing game

A color matching game developed as a hybrid app, written in JavaScript and HTML and using the Cordova hybrid app development tool. Cordova displays the app contents in a webView and wraps the webView with native Android or iOS code to enable it to run as a native app.

To play, a player is given two sets of colors. Each set has two colors that mix to make a third color. Based on these color mixtures, the user has to guess if a new set of colors will mix to produce a new random color. 

The app is available in the Google Play store at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=koji.koji.koji
